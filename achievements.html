				<h1>New Age Hackathon</h1>
				<p>On August 30th 2016, my team and I, a group of 4 students, developed a fitness application and presented it to a panel of 6 judges. The fitness application was designed to specifically aid in tracking the physical and mental well-being of the elderly. The application contained information on the causes, symptoms and solutions to the deadliest diseases. In addition, it included a feature to view tailored guidelines and fitness routine that the doctor recommends a patient to follow. Furthermore, it also included a BMI calculator and instructions to calculate BFP.</p>
				<p>During the development process, I was in charge of and developed the backend software of the application using MIT App Inventor. Although we did not win, we gained an abundance of experience during the entire process of developing a fully functional mobile application for the android platform. This was my first Hackathon and my first time developing a mobile application, thereby it was a challenging experience, but it developed necessary skills such as leadership, time management, communication and team coordination skills.</p>

				<h1>Youth Engineering Association</h1>
				<p>Over the course of a year and a half, from July 2015 to January 2017, my team and I organised a science fair, in addition, we also organised engineering lectures and educational workshops for all high school students. The goal of the science fair was to enable students to learn beyond class material and showcase a viable project that highlights their own interests, learnings and curiosities. The engineering lectures were part of the goal to allow high school students to gain awareness and knowledge of various sub-divisions of engineering, which would enable and aid them to decide the stream of engineering they would like to pursue going into college.</p>
				<p>My role in the YEA consisted of educating students about software engineering and teaching them basics of C++ programming language (procedural paradigm) during the educational workshops. All in all, this was a deeply educating process not only for the high school students but also for the team. I too learnt things beyond class from the engineering lectures from renowned university professors across Singapore and from the research I would conduct for the educational workshops. Besides all of this, the experience has enabled me to build upon my leadership and team coordination skills.</p>

				<h1>SG-50 Young Leader Program</h1>
				<p>As a part of the SG-50 Young Leaders Program, I was held the post of an ambassador from October 2015 to January 2017. Apart from various guest lectures and corporate trips, our team was required to brainstorm solutions for predicaments in the educational system of Singapore. Consequently, our team worked on and presented a research project to a panel of well-known corporate representatives from Singapore.</p>
				<p>This was truly a one of a kind experience, as I learnt a large deal of matter in a relatively short amount of time. This experience had also been a steppingstone to becoming more entrepreneurial in my thought process and developing strong team coordination skills.</p>

				<h1>International Understanding Trip</h1>
				<p>In the week between March 2016 and April 2016, I volunteered at an orphanage in Vietnam as a part of an international understanding trip organised by my high school. Apart from touring the Vietnamese city of Ho Chi Minh, I spent a significant proportion of my time engaging in roles such as caregiving, cooking food and teaching Maths at the orphanage. In addition, to show support to the cause, I, along with my other high school friends, contributed some money to purchase necessary items such as food and clothing for the children at the orphanage. Overall, this had been a truly humbling experience and has made me appreciate things that usually get overlooked by many.</p>
